Sorry this is a piece of code that connects to your wallabag instance from the command line.

I mean it's a wallabag command line client.

Run it like this to see the info on how to use it:

```
python wallanew.py -h
```

To make that work, first you might need to `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  (Or you might want to do that inside of a [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).)

## Some other facts

It's based on work from https://github.com/Nepochal/wallabag-cli/.

It's licensed under MIT license.

It's completely incomplete.

Come on, Sam.
