# Wallabaggins

This is a -- *shiiiiire* ---

Sorry this is a piece of code that connects to your wallabag instance from the command line.

I mean it's a wallabag command line client.

Install it with `pip`, then run:

```
wallabaggins -h
```

You will be prompted for your Wallabag login info, or you can make a config file to store it.

Note, I don't recommend storing your password and client secret in a plain text config file.  If you are running a desktop compatible with Freedesktop.org's [Secret Service](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/secret-service/latest/index.html), then these secrets will be saved in your keyring.
